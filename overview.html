 Generate PDF files containing localized, customizable data, with a focus on astronomy and weather data.
 
 <P>When run as a stand-alone program, the top-level class for generating files is <code>astropdf.Build</code>.
 
 <P>The main design goals are:
 <ul>
  <li>allow <b>customization</b> for a given location and year.
  <li>produce output that's ready to be sent to a printer, without modification.
 </ul>
 
 <P>General remarks:
 <ul>
  <li>the code is written in the PostScript and Java programming languages
  <li>the data comes from three sources: direct computation, .csv data files downloaded manually from the web, 
  and .csv file exports from the MICA tool (phenomena) and Occult.exe (occultations).
  <li>the output is a PostScript .ps file, which is then converted by the system to a PDF format, for the final output.
  <li>a third-party tool is needed to convert PostScript .ps files to .pdf files (Ghostscript or Adobe's Distiller).
  <li>some high-level settings can be changed in a configuration file, without making any code changes.
  <li>for best printing results, you should use a high quality, high resolution printer; many home printers lack high resolution
 </ul>
 
 <P>The good parts:
 <ul>
  <li>customizable for different locations and years
  <li>the output width and height of the PDF is easily changed by a config setting, and the layout reacts dynamically to the new dimensions 
  <li>a mechanism is in place for translation into different languages
  <li>a textual config file is used to let people change some settings without changing any code
  <li>a single config file can be used to generate different kinds of output: calendar, planner, almanac
 </ul>
 
 <P>The bad parts:
 <ul>
  <li>complex layouts and typesetting of text are not supported. 
  For projects in which only small snippets of text occur, this is not a problem (almanacs, calendars, weekly planners).
  <li>right-to-left text flow: no testing has been done for right-to-left languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic. This tool likely does not work for such languages.
  <li>the Text class (used in tranlation) is not suited for use in a servlet environment (since it loads data into a static Map)  
 </ul>
 
 
 An effort has been made to make as few approximations as possible:
 <ul>
  <li>for predicting sunrise and sunset, a special altitude of -0.9 degrees has been added, just below 0.0 degrees. 
  This accounts for refraction at the horizon, the Sun's mean semi-diameter, and for the observer being 
  about 2 meters above the real horizon. (See the Explanatory Supplement to the Ephemeris, 1961, page 401).
  Sunrise and sunset correspond to the center of the Sun's disk being at that altitude.
  For the stars, the rise/set altitude is near -0.57 degrees, not -0.9. 
  For the Moon, the rise/set altitude is in the range of +0.08 to +0.18 degrees, because of its large horizontal parallax.
  <li>the star catalog has precession applied to a given year, configured in a text file. 
  The effect of precession is detectable on a small-scale star chart, even after only 20 years.
 </ul>
 
 <P>Notes about the implementation:
 <ul>
  <li>all .java files use the UTF-8 encoding; your dev environment must also treat them as UTF-8
  <li>all .ps files, containing PostScript snippets, use the 8859-1 encoding. It's important to use that encoding when reading/writing such 
  files; if you don't, then accented characters will appear garbled text with weird characters.
  <li>the fonts are embedded in the PDF
  <li>the author has run this code only on Windows OS, not on Linux
  <li>the logging can be made silent simply by changing one setting in the {@link astropdf.util.LogUtil} class. 
  <li>the model used here has NO TEXT FLOW BETWEEN PAGES. The content of each page is "well known", and won't overflow to the next page.
  When presenting mostly data and little text, this is acceptable.
 </ul>
 
 <P>Some data I used in building this tool:
 <ul>
  <li>stars: the star catalog is from <a href='https://github.com/johanley/star-catalog'>this project</a>
  <li>planets: the VSOP87D data for the planets, by <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988A%26A...202..309B/abstract'>Bretagnon and Francou</a>.
  <li>Moon: the abridged form of ELP 2000-82 as published in Astronomical Algorithms, by Meeus 1991.
  <li>precession: algorithm and tables for P/Q, X/Y, and p/epsilon from 
    <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...534A..22V/abstract'>this paper</a> by Vondr√°k, Capitaine, and Wallace.
 </ul>
 
 <P>Things I'd like to have: 
 <ul>
  <li>access to ELP 2000-85 for the Moon (see above).
  <li>an expression for the inclination of the Moon's orbit, instead of a constant. 
  This may be in Mathematical Astronomy Morsels, by Meeus.
 </ul>
